# 👋 Hi, I'm ZircliX

I'm a solo developer who creates tools and systems but also games for Unity Engine.\
My goal is to make game development easier and faster with helpful tools & systems you can plug right into your games.

## 🔧 Featured Projects
🎯 **[Quest / Objective System](https://github.com/ZircliX/ZCX-Zecex/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/ObjectiveSystem)** – A modular and extensible quest system for Unity. Easily define quests, objectives, and conditions with support for progress tracking, event-driven logic, and customizable workflows. Ideal for RPGs, open-world games, or any title needing structured task progression.\
🎁 **[Reward System](https://github.com/ZircliX/ZCX-Zecex/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/RewardSystem)** – A flexible reward architecture built to decouple reward definition from reward processing. Define custom reward types (like items, currency, XP), then implement how they're applied — making it easy to expand and integrate into your economy or quest systems.

### 📌 Future Projects / Ideas
