## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🎯 [Quest / Objective System](https://github.com/ZircliX/ZCX-Zecex/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/ObjectiveSystem)
A **modular and extensible quest system** for Unity.  
Define quests, objectives, and conditions easily, with:
- ✅ Progress tracking  
- 📌 Event-driven logic  
- 🔁 Customizable workflows  
Perfect for RPGs, open-world titles, or any game with structured tasks.

### 🎁 [Reward System](https://github.com/ZircliX/ZCX-Zecex/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/RewardSystem)
A **flexible reward architecture** that separates reward definition from application.  
Create custom reward types like:
- 💰 Currency  
- 🎁 Items  
- ⭐ XP  
Then define how they're applied — making it easy to expand and integrate with other systems like quests or economies.

## 💡 Fun Fact

Every tool I make is something I *needed myself* while building my own games.  
If it helps me, maybe it'll help you too.
